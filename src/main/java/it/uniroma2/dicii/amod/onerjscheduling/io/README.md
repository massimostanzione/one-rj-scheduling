# package `it.uniroma2.dicii.amod.onerjscheduling.io`

This package is copied and re-adapted from [this other project](https://github.com/massimostanzione/isw2-deliverable2/tree/main/src/it/uniroma2/dicii/isw2/deliverable2/io), as it is a _ready-to-use_ tool for rapidly export classes attributes to CSV files.
